<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
Juxy is a unit testing library for XSLT written in Java. It provides a way to
start any XSLT transformation from Java within specified context, to obtain
the result of the transformation (document fragment) and to apply various checks
on the result.

<p>
Juxy not only allows you to start transformation, but also provides a way to configure
transformation context: global variables, parameters, current node and so on.
The transformation can be started by calling or applying templates.
For called template you can specify name of the template which will be called as
well as template parameters which should be passed to the template.
For applied templates you can specify select expression, mode and template parameters.

<p>
For now Juxy provides two ways of the result checking:
<ul>
    <li>you can evaluate XPath expression over the resulting Node (requires <a href="http://www.jaxen.org/">Jaxen</a> to be added in the classpath)</li>
    <li>or you can compare resulting fragment with expected XML</li>
</ul>
Or you can use <a href="http://xmlunit.sourceforge.net/">XMLUnit</a> for the result checking.
</p>

<p>Juxy does not use any XSLT processor specific extensions, it should work with all
TRaX compliant XSLT processors. For now it is known to work with <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/">Apache Xalan</a>
and <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net">Saxon</a> (both Saxon 6.5.X and Saxon 8.X are supported). XSLT 2.0
templates are known to work with Saxon 8.X, although they are not thoroughly tested.

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>
Juxy works by dynamically creating XSLT stylesheet. From that stylesheet the tested stylesheet is imported
via xsl:import instruction, thus all its templates and variables got lower priority. Any variables and
parameters specified in the transformation context will be placed in the generated stylesheet.
If current node was specified, then corresponding xsl:for-each is added to that stylesheet.
</p>

<p>The returned result Node is always DocumentFragment node. It allows to return not well-formed
documents containing, for example, only text, or more than one root node. This however could
affect XPath expressions which are used to check the result.

<ul>
<li>This index.html will be used if and only if you have the "Use
Project Home Page" option checked on the "Administer Project" page
(click the "Admin" tab).</li>

<li>To edit this file, check out your project via CVS and edit www/index.html.

<li>You can 'cvs add' and commit other files under the project's "www"
directory and they will published to your project web site.</li>

<li>Also, consider starting a thread in the "dev" mailing list to get
these discussion started.  A good one is an "introduction" thread where
people post messages about themselves and their interest in the
project.</li>

<li>You can add a "Highlights:" line to the top of all web pages by adding a file www/project_highlights.html </li>
</ul>

<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>What is the goal of this project?
</p>

<p>What is the scope of this project?
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop just enough functionality to scratch a particular itch</li>
<li>Build a tool just like XYZ, but less broken</li>
<li>Build the best XYZ-tool ever!</li>
</ul>


<p>What are high-level features you are sure to build?
</p>
<ul>

<li>What would you write on a billboard about your project? Users
might only look for a few seconds.</li>

<li>Use the issue tracker to track features and enhancement
requests. It is not just for bugs, pre-populate it with feature
descriptions so that potential contributors know what you would like them
to work on.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the high-level assumptions or ground rules for the project?
</p>

<p>For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li> we will use programming language X on operating system Y for now.

<li>We will, or will not, consider certain functional areas like
internationalization, high security, concurrency, etc.  The list of
functional areas will depend on what you are trying to do.

<li>Try to keep this part short.
</ul>
